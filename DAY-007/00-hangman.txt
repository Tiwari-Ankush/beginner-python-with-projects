what we will use for this amazing hangman project >>
    for and while loops
    if / else conditions
    lists 
    strings 
    range 
    modules 
    

step 1: randomly choose a word from the words and assign it to the variable
step 2: ask to  user to guess the letter and assign their ans to variable >> make guess lowercase
step 3: check if the lette the user guesed is one of the letters in the chosen word

step 4: create an empty list named display. for each letter in chosen word  add a "_" to display. 
        so if the chosen word was "apple" display should be ["_","_","_","_","_"] representing each letter to guess
step 5: loop thrugh each position in the chosen word: if the letter at that pos mathches user_guess then reveal that letter in the display at that position

step 6: user won condition>> use a while loop to let the user gauess again ti;; all the letters in the chosen word and display has no more blanks. then we can tell to the user they have won the game.

step 7: create a variable called lives to keep track of lives left (default >> set lives =6)
step 8: if guess is not a letter in the chosen word, then reduce the lives by 1.  print along with ascii arts
        if lives goes down to the 0 then the game should stop and it should print "you lose"

step 9: join all the elemets of list and turn into a string using join function
